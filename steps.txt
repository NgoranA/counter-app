first create a features folder: it will be made up of all ideas in the projects
secondaly create a folder for each idea and create a slice in eact folder
    in the slice object, define: name, initial value and reducers

let is create our action creators( a function that makes and returns an action.)
createSlice actually makes one for us.
as well as a reducer.


setup the redux store
export the dispatch type and export Rooststate


configure the root _app.ts to share the store to our entire application

Next create a hooks file
    react-redux has hooks and typescript types. but they don't know about the specific state
    so we define predefined versions of those react-redux hooks that already know the write types for our state in our dispatch

        import TypedUsedSelector, useSelector and useDispartch
